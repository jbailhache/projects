The ordinal numbers start with ordinary natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... which are followed by w which represents the "simple" infinity. Then the transfinite ordinals go further with w+1, w+2, w+3, ... w+w = w*2, w*2+1, ..., w*3, ... w*w = w^2, ..., w^3, ... w^w, ... w^(w^w), ..., epsilon 0.
epsilon 0 is the least fixed point of the function a -> w^a, which means the least ordinal such as a = w^a. It is the limit of the sequence 0, w^0, w^(w^0), ...
Then we can go further by searching for the next fixed points of this function. The next one can be obtained by iterating application of function a -> w^a starting with an ordinal which is certainly greater than epsilon 0, for example epsilon 0 + 1. We get the second fixed point called epsilon 1 which is the limit of epsilon 0 + 1, w^(epsilon 0 + 1), w^(w^(epsilon 0 + 1)), ...
We can go on the same way to obtain epsilon 2, epsilon 3, ...
We can consider epsilon as a function a -> epsilon a and say that this function enumerates the fixed points of the function a -> w^a.
Then epsilon w can be defined as the limit of epsilon 0, epsilon 1, epsilon 2, ...
And we can go on with epsilon (omega+1), ..., epsilon (epsilon 0), ... zeta 0.
zeta 0 is the least fixed point of the function epsilon.
Like for epsilon, the function zeta (a -> zeta a) enumerates the fixed points of the function epsilon.
Then there is the function eta which enumerates the fixed points of zeta.
We could go on using successive greek letters, but it is better to number these functions, defining :
phi0(a) = omega^a
phi1(a) = epsilon a
phi2(a) = zeta a
phi3(a) = eta a
and so on.
We can also consider a function phi of two variables (called the binary Veblen function) :
phi(0,a) = omega^a
phi(1,a) = epsilon a
phi(2,a) = zeta a
phi(3,a) = eta a
and so on.
The least ordinal which cannot be obtained with this binary Veblen function is the least fixed point of a -> phi(a,0) which is called Gamma 0. It can still be represented with the phi function if we add a variable to it : Gamma 0 = phi(1,0,0).
We can generalize it with any number of variables : phi(1,0,0,0), ...
An other way to represent an application of the phi function to some ordinals is to indicate the position of the variable (from 0 for the last one) and the corresponding value, only for those which are different from 0, for example :
phi(1,0,5,4) = phi (3:0, 1:5, 0:4)
With this notation it is possible to write easily expressions which would be difficult to write with the complete list of variables, for example phi(1000:1) = phi(1,0,...,0) with 1000 0s.
And even phi(w:1) which can be defined as the limit of phi(0:1) = phi(0,1), phi(1:1) = phi(1,0), phi(2,1) = phi(1,0,0), ... This ordinal is called the small Veblen ordinal.
The smallest ordinal which cannot be represented with this notation is called the large Veblen ordinal. It is the least fixed point of the function a -> phi(a:1), the limit of 0, phi(0:1) = phi(0,1) = w^1 = w, phi(phi(0:1):1) = phi(w:1), phi(phi(phi(0:1):1):1), ...
