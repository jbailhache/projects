Proof of accessibility of all predecessors of Gamma0,
in a type theory with an (external) sequence of 
cumulative universes, containing N, N0, N1, and
closed under both Sigma and Pi. 

Not all the files are used.
The ones that are used are (I think):

	ordlens.agda
	nextU.agda
	ordinals.agda
	naturals.agda
	amenities.agda

(The rest contain experiments, or related
material of some kind.) 

The main theorem is in ordlens.agda
It is called Corollary (!)

This should all be heavily revised.
